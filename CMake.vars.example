# This is a sample CMake.vars file for the Hermes module 'Basic'.
#
# It contains options that let you customize building the module on your 
# system. Options set here override the default ones set in CMakeLists.txt.
#
# NOTE: when specifying paths, always use absolute paths (such as 
# "/home/pavel/something" instead of "~/something").

# Point to the directory where you installed the Hermes library.
set(HERMES_ROOT /home/pavel/build/hermes)

# Enable the C++ version of your module:
set(WITH_CXX      YES)
# Enable the module's Python wrapper. 
set(WITH_PYTHON   YES)
# If the required Python wrappers of the Hermes2D library have not been
# found in the standard directories (${HERMES_ROOT}/lib/python/hermes2d, 
# Python's system directory for modules and some others), you will have
# to point to the directory containing the file   'hermes2d.pxd'   here
#
#   set(HERMES_PYTHON_WRAPPERS_DIR  <home directory of hermes2d.pxd>

# Enable the JavaScript version of your module:
set(WITH_UI       NO)


#------------------------   INSTALLATION   --------------------------

# Installation directory for Python wrappers (OPTIONAL)
#
# Files needed to be imported into your module's Python script may be
# installed into 
#   PYTHON_INSTALL_PATH/hermes_modules
# upon executing 'make install' (or 'sudo make install').
# If not set, PYTHON_INSTALL_PATH will be initialized to the directory
# where your Hermes Python wrappers have been placed.  Otherwise, the specified
# destination directory will be used. As a third alternative, you may 
# uncomment the following line to install the module into the default place 
# where Python stores its modules:
#
#  set(PYTHON_INSTALL_PATH   USE_SYSTEM_PYTHON_DIRECTORY)
#
# Execute the following command to see where the files will come in this case:
#
#   python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()"
# 
# Note that in the former two cases, you will probably have to point to the 
# non-default destination directory at the beginning of your Python script, e.g.:
#   import sys; sys.path.append("/home/pavel/build/hermes/lib/python")
#
